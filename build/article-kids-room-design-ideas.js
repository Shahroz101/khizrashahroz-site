      "A full mural is one option, like the galaxy scene here with its own rocket, planets, and a round rug that keeps the theme going underfoot. If that's more commitment than you're ready for, removable decals and a themed rug get you most of the magic without the multi-weekend paint job.",

      "I get the hesitation. Handing a kid design authority over their own room sounds like a recipe for neon everything.",

A small tent or teepee corner loaded with pillows gives them a spot that's entirely their own scale.",

<p>If your kid's room currently looks like a toy store lost a fight with a laundry basket, you are extremely not alone. The good news is you don't need a full renovation or a design degree to turn it around &mdash; you need a handful of ideas that actually survive contact with a seven-year-old.</p>
<p>I've put together more kids' rooms than I can count at this point, and the pattern is always the same: the spaces that work aren't the most expensive ones, they're the ones built around how kids actually use a room. Play happens on the floor. Art gets made constantly. Phases come and go fast.</p>
<p>Here are ten ideas that balance a little bit of imagination with a lot of real-world practicality &mdash; the kind that still looks good after a week of actual use.</p>

<h2>10 Kids Room Ideas Worth Trying</h2>
${ideas.map(ideaBlock).join("\n")}

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>A great kids room was never really about matching throw pillows. It's about building a space where your child feels like the room belongs to them &mdash; and where cleanup has at least a fighting chance.</p>
<p>The best part of these ideas is how little they lock you in. Swap a theme, rotate the art wall, adjust a zone as your kid grows, and the bones of the room keep working without you starting from zero every year.</p>
<p>Pick one idea and start there. The rest can follow whenever you're ready.</p>
